## About me
I build clean, maintainable web apps with a focus on front-end UX and reliable back-end APIs. I like well-structured projects, automated tests and shipping small, visible improvements often.

- 🔭 Current focus: finishing **Helicopteros VIP** (ride-booking prototype) — frontend in React/Next.js, backend in Firebase.
- 🌱 Lifelong learner: deepening knowledge of deployment, testing, and production-ready tooling.
- 🎵 When not coding: practicing piano and listening to jazz standards.

## Skills & Tools
**Comfortable:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Next.js, HTML/CSS, SASS, Tailwind, Node.js, Firebase, Git  
**Familiar / learning:** Python (Django/Flask), Jest, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Docker
